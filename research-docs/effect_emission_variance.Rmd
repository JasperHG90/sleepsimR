# Introduction

In this notebook, I investigate $4$ scenarios of the mHMMbayes model to observe the effect of different within (residual) and between variances of the sleep dataset. The following scenarios are investigated:

|                   |      | Between-subject variance        |                                 |
|-------------------|------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
|                   |      | *Low*                             | *High*                            |
| **Residual variance** | *Low*  |  Residual: +-0.2 Between: +-0.1 |  Residual: +-0.2 Between: +-0.4 |
|                   | *High* |  Residual: +-0.6 Between: +-0.1 |  Residual: +-0.6 Between: +-0.4 |

Given that the emission distributions overlap across states, it would be useful to get an idea of which variance term has a large effect on the ability of the model to adequately estimate model parameters.
