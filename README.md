sleepsimR is an R library that contains convenience functions to generate simulation scenarios, to run an mHMM, to simulate datasets and to obtain MAP estimates.

This program was created as part of my Master's thesis. For more information, read the full documentation at: <https://github.com/JasperHG90/sleepsimR-documentation>
